				Cell Biology VR
			</h2>
			<p>
				This was a project commmission by a Biology professor to reconstruct a cell that a student can explore. It stays simplified for the course material it was designed for and tests the students on their Biology knowledge to
				complete the assignment. Students are to go to each organelle and configure it using levers. They will be guided to some extent and given a few tries. After they complete that stage, a new stage occurs that causes an extracellular
				event. In this case, it was heat stress, and the student will have to reconfigure the cell to adapt to the new situation with new options present and new areas of the cell they can explore.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was the former project lead of this project. I met with the professor on a bi-weekly basis, and designed the systems to read lesson files that store the organelle positions and answers, in case this project was expanded upon. I learned
				Niagara systems to create many particle systems to add visual flair in the VR headset without taxing it too much from traditional means. I also created a lesson editor, which is an inhouse tool (accessible as a map in the Unreal Engine project
				files) that allows other developers to easily design different lessons for testing purposes or to create alterations of the existing elements per the client's requests. I also worked with our artist to provide art inspirations based on the professor'srequirements
				and to ensure that the technical design of the models allowed our programmers to easily adjust them for the spawn systems and visual display.
