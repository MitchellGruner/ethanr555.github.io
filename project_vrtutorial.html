					This is demonstration footage of the VR Tutorial in action. This is an example of a playthrough of the tutorial. The black background in the beginning of the footage would be passthrough of the Meta Quest 2, but due to

				VR Tutorial
			</h2>
			<p>
				The VR Tutorial is Unreal Plugin designed for internal use for the xREAL Lab. It is designed to teach users the xREAL VR control scheme and help first time users get acustomed to VR.
			</p>
			<p>
				I solely created this after it was expressed that the lab needed a tutorial for new users. We already had a few measures of creating tutorial schemes within each project, but having a standardized way to implement
				tutorial elements and reduce future workload was desired. As a result, I created a modular and scalable tutorial plugin that can easily be added to xREAL projects, configured to each project's specific control scheme.
				Over time, more tutorial modules can be easily added as the standardized control scheme gets expanded over time.
