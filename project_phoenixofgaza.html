				Phoenix of Gaza Unreal
			</h2>
			<p>
				This is the Phoenix of Gaza, a project designed to reveal the inner life of the strip of Gaza that is not normally revealed to the outside world.  The unreal version attempts to recreate and enhance the original
				Mozilla Hubs version by recreating the core features that were present, and then utilizing the Unreal Engine capabilities to further enhance this vision.
			</p>
			<p>
				The original version utilized Mozilla Hubs to hosted the imagery and videos of Gaza, but it was running into technical limitations. Utilizing PixelStreaming, this version was recreated in Unreal by using PixelStreaming
				to create the accessibilty that allows people who do not have the desktop or vr hardware to view the enhanced graphics of the Unreal Engine version. In addition epxeriences such as 360 photo spheres were enhanced with C++
				(not possible with Mozilla Hubs) to allow the camera to be perfectly centered in the 360 sphere, and allowed the 360 sphere to be expanded client-side and a video to play that replaces the image thumbnail. The Unreal version
				recreates the multiplayer by taking advantage of Unreal Engine's built-in multiplayer systems, along with Vivox functionality to add excellent free voice chat for this small project. When I stopped working on it, there was much
				to be added, but I provided the core foundation and functionality that were the biggest concerns with the project.
