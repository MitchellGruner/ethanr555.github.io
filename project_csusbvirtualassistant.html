			CSUSB Virtual Assistant
			</h2>
			<p>
				The CSUSB Virtual assistant was an in development learning assistant intended on helping students navigate and answer logistical and educational answers regarding their class schedules. The last build I worked on
				contained two key modes: class schedule questions and syllabus questions. Class schedule questions allows students to ask questions regarding the current class schedule, such as if a certain course is available, times
				the course is at, how many seats are available, etc. The syllabus questions mode allowed students to be able to enter a course number (in the demonstration, we used a select few syllabus', with permission from the respective
				professors) and ask questions regarding the syllabus, such as who the professor is, if they can earn an incomplete, when listed assignments are due, how to contact the professor, etc.
			</p>

				The development I was involved with regarding this project was creating the Unreal engine front-end client for the GPT-4 powered server. The client utilized key plugins to help speed up development to have a working prototype, such as
				socket.io support, metahuman visuals, and oculus lip sync. What I did was interface with the socket.io library to communicate to a python server developed by another developer. The question answer flow is as follows:
				<ul>
				<li>Audio input would be captured from student asking the question. </li>
				<li> Audio bytes are sent to python server, where it converts the bytes into text through GPT-Whisper.</li>
				<li> Text is sent back to client. Client then send text back to server to get an answer. </li>
				<li> Server receives question, and through GPT-4 retrieves an answer, after prefacing question with important data related to the question (for example, class schedule information) </li>
				<li> Server returns answer, and client receives it.</li>
				<li> Client parses through answer, fragmenting it into smaller chunks, and then sends each substring answer concurrently to the server to receive an audio bytes version. </li>
				<li> Server receives each audio byte bunch, and utilizes Google Cloud Text To Speech to make audio bytes.</li>
				<li> Client receives each audio byte chunk, and concurrently renders Oculus Lip Sync animation for the respective audio chunk. </li>
				<li> Once the render for the first audio chunk is finished, the animation and audio for said chunk starts playing to the user. each chunk and animation finished during this will be queued.</li>
				<li> Once the client plays through each chunk. It waits for another question. </li>
				</ul>
				I interaced all these plugins to work in tandem with each other, and properly ensured that the client remained compatible with server updates as time went on.
