			Reconnections: 5-player multiplayer VR experience
			</h2>
			<p>
				Reconnections is a 5-player multiplayer VR experience that tests the players on making eco-friendly, selfless choices or eco-harmful, selfish choices. Four players strap on the
				VR headsets to complete these tasks and reach the center of the island, where they will finally be able to see who else was altering the environment around them. The 5th player
				would be one of the people executing the study, watching all 4 players play as an invisible spectator on a standard Windows computer.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was involved for most of its development. I was responsible for altering/upgrading several core concept ideas including changing the motivation systems for the tasks to be based on
				real-life investments (time and challenge each option would present) rather than something like hunger or thirst like the client's original ideas were (there were no systems planned
				to punish/reward survival mechanics that hunger and thirst would affect). I was responsible for upgrading the code structure and systems utilizted in this project to be more scalable
				and modular to our client's and project needs as we continued developing. With my team, we adapted the entire code base of the project into Unreal's multiplayer framework, which would
				be the xREAL's first foray into multiplayer projects. I along with a collegue, were responsible for determining how adapt the code base by determining how the tasks will translate to other
				users, how they will load into the server and how the players will be able to interact with each other. I was responsible for initiating the push to include the fifth player for specating 
				and server logging of events. Towards the latter half of the development cycle, I took on a more managerial position of ensuring the final parts of the projects fit into the codebase developed
				for the changed requirements of the project.
